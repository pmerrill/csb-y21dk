# TODO

- [ ] Retire if career rtg below x after x years pro
- [ ] Add isStarter flag to regulate stats. Pass yds around 1,500 is weird.
- [ ] Move logic for QBs into quarterback.js
- [ ] Teams should be more likely to retain/trade based on career stats
- [ ] Use last season's TD and INT % to influence next season
- [ ] Add colleges and draft. College stats influence draft spot (if at all) and if starter. 
- [ ] Player names and avatars
- [ ] Ability to submit HOF QBs to global leaderboard if rtg > x
